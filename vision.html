        <p>Rhythms create space for being with God and allow us to live in alignment with our deepest desires. Through the regular practice of these rhythms we gain a vision and means for becoming truly human.</p>

        <p class="headline">Return</p>
        <p>The “human condition” is often described as a sense that something is missing in our lives. We believe that sense is what Jesus came to address by giving us a picture of a God who is love and making a way to God through his life and cross – a picture of God’s love. By returning to God on a daily and even moment by moment basis we discover our original Source and Resource for living a beautiful life.</p>

        <p class="headline">Relationship</p>
        <p>To engage people in a space that is mutually self-giving and free of pretense is a reality in which we thrive. We seek to engage the rhythm of relationship by responding to small prompts to make contact with others as well as the weekly community gatherings.

        <p class="headline">Generosity</p>
        <p>Through generosity we rise above the smallness of greed and expand our personal and corporate impact on the planet and in each other. We seek to engage the rhythm of generosity by committing a portion of our regular income to the Church and other organizations that are working to proliferate heaven on earth.

        <p>Seeing the world and the people in it as our responsibility is an ancient rhythm of the Church. By responding daily, weekly, monthly and yearly to the needs of the world around us is a big part of being truly human.

        <p>Central to being human is rest. Through rest we learn our place in the cosmos as limited yet made for the Infinite. Times of respite become the place where our energies in their limitedness are expanded and directed in the unlimited nature and power of God.

        <p>
        We all give ourselves to rhythms of creativity.  Whether it be writing a song or teaching a kid to read –  God has made it so that we are inextricably connected to the restoration of creation.  By responding daily to the muse of God’s Spirit we contribute to Heaven coming to earth.
